Data Model Capacities:
    Home page: information on Montalvo and how to become involved
        Searchable by:
            Grade level (filter)
            Academic content area (filter)
            Artistic content area(filter)
            Pedagogical approach(filter)
            General word search
        Editable and/or options for iterations
 
Initial phase “must-haves”:
        Access to lesson plans
        Account to access lesson plans
Initial phase “wish-list”:
        Editing and interaction among users
Tertiary “wish-list”:
        Uploading personal lesson plans that source our template



Examples of some databases:
http://www.calacademy.org/educators/lesson-plans
        We really like this one for its search capacity BUT would like the populated thumbnails to have the basic information about grade, artistic discipline, and academic content
        They also use a pdf format for the actual lessons
        Their landing page is a little messy for our aesthetics
http://arts-impact.org/lesson-plan/
        Filters are limiting without a general word search
        Not very attractive
https://www.edutopia.org/blogs/tag/lesson-plans
        Can’t figure out how to search this one
https://educationcloset.com/arts-integration-lessons/
        Search options are limited here, but like them at the top of the page
        While the listing of Leeson plans below is a bit much, perhaps we have “featured” lessons called out?
https://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/educators/lessons
        This is our favorite…but still a bit too busy in terms of the layout – we’d like to use more of that real estate for some biographical information about our organization
